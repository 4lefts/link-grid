# Link Grid

A super-simple web app for aggregating useful links into one page for schools. Allows setting up a home page for small children logging in to Google Apps Edu accounts that has all the links to commonly used sites and apps in one place.

To do:

- ~~Simple database backend **with auth**~~
- add db rules and regex checking for only school staff emails
- ~~Then admin workflow to allow editing links~~
- ~~Adding and removing links~~
- ~~confirm delete box~~
- ~~add and update message box~~
- Color picker <- work in progress
- cancel edit button (also press esc?)
- favicon
- ~~loading component~~
- Logos for links that provide them
- File upload to firebase for logo images and background image
- Image blur up (especially for background)
