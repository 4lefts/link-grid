# Link Grid

A super-simple web app for aggregating useful links into one page for schools. Allows setting up a home page for small children logging in to Google Apps Edu accounts that has all the links to commonly used sites and apps in one place.

To do:

- ~~Simple database backend **with auth**~~
- ~~add db rules and regex checking for only school staff emails~~
- ~~Then admin workflow to allow editing links~~
- ~~Adding and removing links~~
- ~~confirm delete box~~
- ~~add and update message box~~
- ~~Color picker~~
- ~~cancel edit button (also press esc?)~~
- ~~loading component~~
- favicon
- up and down buttons to reorder links? requires restructuring data?
- Logos for links that provide them - how does Google Keep etc generate thumbnails?
- Image blur up (especially for background)
